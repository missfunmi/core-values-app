  - [ ] onBeforeDragStart or onDragStart while in column, hide plus button?
  - [ ] How to prevent draggable from snapping back into column on a false drop?
- [ ] Local persistence?
- [ ] Add sticky Navigation bar, see [example](https://github.com/M0nica/ambition-fund-website/blob/master/src/components/common/navigation/navigation.jsx)
  - [ ] Scroll to sections on clicking Continue button
  - [ ] Check out 'react-scrollspy' and 'react-anchor-link-smooth-scroll'
- [ ] License
- [ ] CI/CD
- [ ] Logging library [logrocket](https://logrocket.com/)

## Future
- [ ] Use redux?
- [ ] Responsive design w/ [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)m [docs](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet)
- [ ] Fix spacing/padding (use Bootstrap?)
- [ ] Use Bootstrap icons? [here](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/plus/)
- [ ] Can grouping column contents be centered? May require more complex CSS or animation finagling. [See here](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/issues/1851)
- [ ] Dragging outside of the column snaps back to column first before appearing in core values panel - FIX THIS
- [ ] Add ability to add new columns?
- [ ] Use onDragStart to toggle isDropDisabled on the main panel? [See here](https://react-beautiful-dnd.netlify.app/?path=/story/ondragstart--toggle-isdropdisabled-ondragstart)
- [ ] More animations
- [ ] SEO? [oyato](https://oyatocloud.com/)
- [ ] Mobile-friendly version?
- [ ] Check out other analytics: [matomo](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23560823), [goaccess](https://goaccess.io/), [nytimes](https://github.com/NYTimes/react-tracking) or [here](https://open.nytimes.com/introducing-react-tracking-declarative-tracking-for-react-apps-2c76706bb79a), [larger round-up](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/822568/61d29096a4012e06/)

- [ ] Mobile-friendly version?

## Investigate issues
- [x] Animation for dropping into the group column is bad, the bubble snaps to top left corner first before the flex center styling applies. How to fix? [Identical issue](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/issues/1851)
- [ ] What's this scroll-linked position error?
  ````
  This site appears to use a scroll-linked positioning effect. This may not work well with asynchronous panning; see https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Performance/ScrollLinkedEffects for further details and to join the discussion on related tools and features!
  ````
- [x] Another error to investigate -- culprit is intro.js library. Only exists for IE browsers. [Link](https://github.com/usablica/intro.js/blob/b46bbcd8af46be2ae3b43aba850334b12ff03cdb/introjs.css#L234)
  ````
  This page uses the non standard property ‚Äúzoom‚Äù. Consider using calc() in the relevant property values, or using ‚Äútransform‚Äù along with ‚Äútransform-origin: 0 0‚Äù.
  ````

## Performance
- [ ] Do not re-render other draggables during/after the drag. See [here](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/issues/1791)
- [ ] Allow dragging between grouping columns without affecting state in the core values main panel
- [ ] Columns are rendered twice on page load
- [ ] Do not re-render draggables when selecting - brief UI flash particularly noticeable on mobile
- [ ] Fonts on first load???

## Funsies
- [ ] Add animation on selecting in top panel

## Colors
- #e04b11 orange
- #3d8af7 bright blue
- #3b4754 dark blue
